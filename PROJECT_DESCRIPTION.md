# LakeSide Hotel Booking System - Frontend Application

**Full-Stack Hotel Management Platform | React.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS**

I built this hotel booking application to help manage room inventory and reservations for a hotel business. The frontend connects to a RESTful backend API, giving users a smooth way to browse rooms, make bookings, and manage their reservations.

The application handles the complete booking workflow - from searching and filtering available rooms by type and price, to completing reservations with guest details and date selection. I implemented a comprehensive room management system that lets administrators add, edit, and delete room listings, with support for photo uploads and real-time data updates.

For the user experience, I focused on making the interface intuitive and responsive. Users can filter rooms dynamically, navigate through paginated results, and view detailed room information before booking. The booking process captures all necessary guest information including check-in/check-out dates and occupancy details.

I integrated authentication features so users can create accounts and log in securely. Form validation and error handling ensure data integrity, with clear success and error messaging throughout the application.

On the technical side, I used React with modern hooks for state management, React Router for navigation, and Axios for API integration. The UI is built with Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap, creating a clean and modern design. I also handled image conversion between different formats (base64, blob, binary) to ensure photos display correctly across different browsers and devices.

The codebase is well-organized with reusable components, and I implemented proper separation of concerns between UI components, API utilities, and routing logic. This made the project maintainable and easy to extend with additional features.
